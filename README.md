# tableau_dashboard_supermarket

I wanted to learn a data viz tool as many job post asks it then i chose Tableau.

I used a dataset that is already in Tableau (supermarket dataset) donc train. I end up doing a dashboard combining all files i had. Find in the .pdf for the dashboard looking. Because I only have the free version I cant deploy anything.

Tableau is a fun and efficient tool if you want to make a quick dashboard, i highly recommend you "Alex the analyst" on Youtube and his quick tutos on Tableau if you want to learn how to use Tableau.  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8GwbqoVmo_5zuhOa0Tcl3xC
